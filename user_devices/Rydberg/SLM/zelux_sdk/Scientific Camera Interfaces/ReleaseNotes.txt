Revision 1.3 (LINUX)
 - A new version of the color processing components which includes:
    - a new API method which enables the consumer to write color processing
      output buffers with 16 bits per pixel plus a padding word.
    - a new SSE optimized color processing pipeline.
    - various bug fixes.
 - A new polarization processor component for use with polarization cameras.
    - the polarization C API is not officially released so it is subject to change 
      as indicated by the leading 0 in its version number (0.24.0.0).
 - Updated C camera SDK
    - includes the latest API (breaking) changes 
    - includes support for polarization cameras.
    - a few bug fixes.
 - New mono to color SDK
    - a more user friendly component for color processing images from color sensor cameras.
    - has a narrower and easier to use API than the general purpose color processing component.
 - New Python SDK
    - an SDK for customers writing applications in Python.
    - include support for:
        - monochrome image processing.
        - color camera image processing.
        - polarization camera image processing.

Revision D (2019-05-20) (WINDOWS)
 - Python support added.
 - Updates to C Camera Interface to add the polar phase for polarization cameras.
 - New color processing transform_48_to_64 added.
 - Updates to C examples.
 - Mono to color C examples added.
 - Bug fixes.
 
Revision 1.2 (LINUX)
 - Fixed an issue with vector AVX2 demosaic.
 
Revision C (2019-02-08) (WINDOWS)
